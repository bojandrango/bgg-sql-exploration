# BoardGameGeek SQL data exploration

Based on the BoardGameGeek data fetched with [the Python script](https://github.com/ognard/bgg-batch-fetcher) (and [this script](https://github.com/ognard/bgg-csv-splitter)) I've created before, I have made some SQL data exploration for the datasets that are available in this repository. You can check the SQL queries in the `queries.sql` file in this repo, or clone the repo to your machine and use the datasets for your own exploration needs.
